        <h2>1- Analysis</h2>

        <p>
          The sole purpose of switching to a new information system is to create
          an information system that is more efficient, productive, traceable
          and produces reports that will inform decision-making mechanisms
          correctly. This requires a good understanding of the company's
          business processes, objectives and the challenges to be faced during
          the transition to the new system. In the "AYZ Methodology",
          understanding the needs, objectives and analyzing the existing
          structure are carried out in 3 steps.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Management Reports (Top-down Approach)
            <p>
              In the first step of the analysis phase, it is necessary to
              discuss with the company management their expectations from the
              information system and the reports they want what they are and
              whether they can be obtained, and if so the departments and
              methods by which they are obtained and is documented.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Operational Operations (Bottom-up Approach)
            <p>
              The organization established to carry out the day-to-day
              operations of the business system (manual and/or partial
              automation) and what work is done (work flow and processes),
              challenges encountered and solutions problem areas that need to be
              addressed are identified and documented It is done.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Identification of Technical Assets
            <p>
              What is the network, hardware and software status of the existing
              system, whether it can meet the objectives is measured and
              documented.

        <h2>2- Design and Project</h2>

        <p>
          The most important design lens of the AYZ Methodology is the accuracy
          of information, quality and cost-effective creation. Information, from
          below it must flow upwards in such a way that the management wants to
          achieve the reports will be self-generated.
        </p>

        <p>
          To achieve this objective, the AYZ Methodology is implemented in the
          LBS database. Company(s)/ Workplace(s)/ Department(s)/ Warehouse(s)
          definitions, coding prepare methods and information flow diagrams and
          enter information guidelines (in accordance with departments'
          obligation to enter information) creates. Determines the authorization
          levels and roles of users. Create a new server to ensure
          high-performance operation of the information system, local and remote
          office networks can improve the performance of system users. prepares
          proposals on issues such as technical requirements that will enhance
          the project. The project is discussed with company managers and
          employees, and the work program is converted.

          3- Customization, Installation and Data Conversions, Additional
          Software
        </h2>

        <h4>Installation</h4>

        <p>
          The installation of Logo Gold on the server, the provision of the
          server when necessary, the preparation of the database according to
          the criteria during the design phase is carried out during the
          installation phase.
        </p>

        <h4>Data Conversion</h4>

        <p>
          One of the common problems when migrating to a new information system
          is to make data from the old system available in the new system. AYZ;
          Logo AS400, BTrieve, LKS, Paradox, Access and SQL databases AYZ
          Translator software that will enable easy transfer to Gold has
          developed.
        </p>

        <h4>Privatization</h4>

        <p>
          The companies are based on the industry they are in, production,
          distribution, sales According to their methods, what they expect from
          the information system differs. AYZ, Customizes GOLD to the company
          through tailoring.
        </p>

        <h4>Development of Additional Software</h4>

        <p>
          LBS software is rich and compatible with the realities of Turkey.
          However, if additional software is required to complete automation To
          meet this need identified during the design phase, AYZ, Visual Basic,
          very common Microsoft® products such as MS SQL Server and Web
          Complementary software using based e-business applications is
          developing.

          number of employees of a company experience, wisdom and expertise are
          the sole determinants of a company's success. is the element.
        </p>

        <p>
          The AYZ Methodology is a methodology that helps company employees to
          be eager to transition to the new system. to ensure that they are able
          to be a part of the design process. During the design phase, all users
          are consulted for their opinions, so users will be able to are willing
          to be active and voluntary users of the system.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before the training, training groups are formed by taking into account
          the roles of individuals or departments. According to the training
          groups, AYZ experts prepare a "User Guide" that employees can refer to
          later. Employees are given comparative training in groups with
          reference to the "User Guide". Differences and conveniences between
          the new system and the old system are explained.

        <p>
          After implementation, the conformity of the new information system
          with the design criteria, whether the objectives have been achieved,
          and the ability to produce the reports requested by the management are
          measured. Possible deviations or changes are identified and additional
          arrangements are made.

        <p>
          LBS GOLD has a rich built-in reporting system. However, one in
          addition to these reports, many executives are looking for more
          compact and consolidated needs reports. AYZ, Navigator and its own
          Visual Basic library and methods to create a fast-running and Gold
